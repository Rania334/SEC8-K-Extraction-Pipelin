 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are thrilled to announce this collaboration, as it combines Alnylam&#146;s proven track record in
RNAi therapeutics with Roche&#146;s global commercial reach, commitment to innovation and desire to transform the landscape for patients with severe cardiovascular diseases,&#148; said Yvonne Greenstreet MBChB, Chief Executive Officer
of&nbsp;Alnylam. &#147;With this collaboration, we now can develop zilebesiran in a more robust way, allowing us to have cardiovascular outcomes data in hand at launch to ensure results relevant not only for health authorities but also for access
and clinical practice in order to ultimately reach as many patients as possible.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are excited to work together with Alnylam and leverage
our strong R&amp;D capabilities, our leadership in cardiovascular diagnostics and our global commercial footprint to further develop and provide this promising therapy with
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">best-in-disease</FONT></FONT> potential to patients,&#148; said Teresa Graham, CEO Roche Pharma. &#147;Throughout our history, we have redefined the standard of care across various
disease areas. Together with a strong partner like Alnylam, we are looking forward to making a significant impact for patients living with hypertension at high cardiovascular risk and potentially other cardiovascular indications.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In a <U>Phase 1 study</U>, zilebesiran, compared to placebo, was associated with dose-dependent reductions in serum angiotensinogen (AGT), achieving tonic
blood pressure control with consistent and durable blood pressure reduction throughout a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">24-hour</FONT> period, sustained up to six months after single doses of &#8805;200 mg. Zilebesiran also demonstrated an
acceptable safety profile supporting continued clinical development. The safety and efficacy of zilebesiran are being investigated in Alnylam&#146;s KARDIA Phase 2 clinical program either as a monotherapy
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(KARDIA-1)</FONT> or in combination with one of three <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">standard-of-care</FONT></FONT> antihypertensive medications
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(KARDIA-2).</FONT> Based on the positive Phase 1 data, zilebesiran could potentially be a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">best-in-disease</FONT></FONT> treatment and provide
transformational benefit, especially for patients with hypertension at high cardiovascular risk. Zilebesiran also has the potential to improve adherence to&nbsp;treatment due to its possible biannual subcutaneous dosing regimen. In addition,
zilebesiran may be effective in additional potential cardiovascular indications with high unmet need. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam will
receive an upfront cash payment of $310&nbsp;million and is eligible to receive additional substantial near-term payments, including development milestone payments over the next few years, as well as regulatory and sales milestones, for a potential
deal value of up to $2.8&nbsp;billion. In addition, Alnylam is entitled to an equal profit share in the U.S., where Alnylam and Roche will <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-commercialize</FONT> zilebesiran. Roche obtained the exclusive right to
commercialize zilebesiran outside the U.S. in exchange for low double digit royalties on net sales of zilebesiran outside of the U.S. Alnylam believes that this partnership will allow the companies to pursue a joint development plan and
commercialization approach that has the potential to unlock the full value of zilebesiran. Additionally, Alnylam will lead a joint clinical development plan for the first indication with Roche&#146;s participation, which includes a cardiovascular
outcomes trial prior to submission of zilebesiran for regulatory approval, with all development costs shared 40% by Alnylam and 60% by Roche. Roche may lead development for additional indications in the future. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Zilebesiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen (AGT) in Phase 2 development for the treatment of
hypertension in high unmet need populations. AGT is the most upstream precursor in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), a cascade which has a demonstrated role in blood pressure (BP) regulation and its inhibition has well-established
anti-hypertensive effects. Zilebesiran inhibits the synthesis of AGT in the liver, potentially leading to durable reductions in AGT protein and ultimately, in the vasoconstrictor angiotensin (Ang) II. Zilebesiran utilizes Alnylam&#146;s Enhanced
Stabilization Chemistry Plus (ESC+) GalNAc-conjugate technology, which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased selectivity and a wide therapeutic index. The safety and efficacy of zilebesiran have not been established or evaluated by the FDA, EMA
or any other health authority. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About Hypertension </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hypertension is a complex multifactorial disease clinically defined by most major guidelines as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of above 140 mm Hg and/or a
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mm Hg, though AHA/ACC guidelines have a lower threshold of a SBP above 130 mm Hg and/or a DBP greater than 80 mm Hg. More than one billion people worldwide live with hypertension.<SUP
STYLE="font-size:75%; vertical-align:top">1</SUP> In the U.S. alone, approximately 47&nbsp;percent of adults live with hypertension, with more than half of patients on medication remaining above the blood pressure (BP) target level. Despite the
availability of anti-hypertensive medications, there remains a significant unmet medical need, especially given the poor rates of adherence to existing daily oral medications and daily peak and trough effects, resulting in inconsistent BP control
and an increased risk for stroke, heart attack and premature death.<SUP STYLE="font-size:75%; vertical-align:top">2</SUP> In particular, there are a number of high unmet need settings where novel approaches to hypertension warrant additional
development focus, including patients with poor medication adherence, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">difficult-to-treat</FONT></FONT> and resistant hypertension, and in patients with high cardiovascular risk. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology
and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as &#147;a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,&#148; and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the
natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines known as RNAi therapeutics is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam&#146;s RNAi therapeutic platform,
function upstream of today&#146;s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) &#150; the genetic precursors &#150; that encode for disease-causing or disease pathway proteins, thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary
approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About&nbsp;Alnylam Pharmaceuticals </B></P>
